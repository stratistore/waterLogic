The problem is, you only have a 5 gallon (18.9 L) jug and a 3 gallon jug on hand! This classic riddle, made famous in Die Hard 3, may seem impossible without a measuring cup, but it is actually remarkably simple.\r\n\r\nFor the solution, click on the SOLVE BUTTON to skip to the answer. If you want guidance and hints to solving it on your own, scroll down.                                                     \r\n**1**   Simplify the question and your options. Setting the movie aside for the moment, think of the riddle in it's most basic terms. What do you know, what's your goal, and what are your options? A simpler way to look at the riddle might be: \r\nYou have two empty water jugs in your hands. One holds 3 gallons of water, the other holds 5 gallons of water. You need to use these two jugs to measure exactly 4 gallons of waters.                                                              \r\n**2**  Determine where you will keep the 4 gallons of water. In order to measure out your 4 gallons, you need to put it somewhere. As John McClane rightly deduces, you couldn't possible fit it in the 3 gallon jug, which means the right answer must involve getting the right amount of water in the 5 gallon jug.    \r\n**3**   Know that, like all good riddles, you have everything you need for a solution.The solution does not involve bringing in another jug, or eyeballing the water levels perfectly, or finding fractions of jugs. You have two jugs and an unlimited supply of water. How can you use just those things to get to 4 gallons? More specifically, how can you use 3 and 5 to get to 4?\r\n\t◦\tUnlimited water means you can use or pour out as much as you want.\r\n\t◦\tYou are not able to guess exactly how much water is in the jug unless you fill it all the way up.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
